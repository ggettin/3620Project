Cowboy:

	252 standard compute nodes
		dual intel Xeon E5-2620 Sandy Bridge hex core 2.0 GHz w/32GB of 1333 MHz RAM
	2 “fat nodes”
		256 GB RAM and an NVIDIA Tesla C2075 card

I think C6220 is the best match to Cowboy (Dual 8-core processors vs. Dual 6-Core, 64GB of RAM vs. 32GB)

Home node: C8220
Fat node: C4130

Install mpi, nfs, and stuff: check for the Canvas discussion thread

For our environment modules, I think we can just install the environment-modules package mentioned in Steven Nix's discussion thread,
then copy the module files from Palmetto, which are stored at /software/modulefiles/
